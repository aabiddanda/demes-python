# Tools for describing and manipulating demographic models.

A demographic model describes one or more demes (or popululations),
how they change over time, and their relationships to one another.
`demes` provides a self-contained and unambiguous in-memory description
of a demographic model.

## Goals
- A simple declarative format for specifying a demographic model.
- Unify the specification of demographic models across different frameworks.
- Robust validation of models and reporting of errors for invalid models.
- Agnostic to choice of time-parameterisation (forwards, backwards,
  continuous, discrete).
- Incremental. A model can be constructed incrementally, remaining valid
  at each step of construction.
- Extensible. It should be easy to extend the in-memory description with
  additional properties.
- Mutable. When modifying an existing model, changes should cascade naturally
  through to dependent properties. Incompatibilities should be reported.
